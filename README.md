Installation:
Important! Please follow the steps EVERY TIME you update a Klockheed Martian Mod! All public releases are located here:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r93q90vpb...4h1_WtfFGa/KSP

a) Download the latest version of the base Klockheed Martian Mod from here. It is just called "Klockheed_Martian".
b) Download the desired Klockheed Martian mods (e.g., Klockheed_Martian_SSE for Space Shuttle Engines).
c) Delete the Klockheed Martian base folder (GameData\Klockheed_Martian).
d) If you update mod, delete its folder too (e.g., GameData\Klockheed_Martian_SSE)
d) Unzip both files and copy the GameData folders to your GameData Folder.


The base folder is required for common plugin functionality that is shared by all Klockheed Martian mods.
