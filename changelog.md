### Using the wet workshop parts

* You can turn any fuel tank (even 5m KW Rocketry Tanks) into a space station now. Follow these steps:
  * Attach the door to a tank
  * Launch your rocket and drain the tank COMPLETELY. (Smart Parts has a fuel valve to help with that!)
  * Bring supplies and transfer these to the door.
  * Klick the door and convert empty tanks to empty space to living space
  * Bring kerbals to the door
* Right now all happens in the door. Depending on the feedback, I might continue this and extend it with connected living space support, etc
