## Version 2.2.0.0-release

* raidernick
* missing archive

* Fixed part animations
* Fixed part scaling, remove mm config fix if you have it
* Converted all textures to MBM to fix tga issues
* Removed broken tweak scale version from zip, please download latest version here(YOU NEED IT): http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80234
* Updated info for new license

### Using the wet workshop parts

* You can turn any fuel tank (even 5m KW Rocketry Tanks) into a space station now. Follow these steps:
  * Attach the door to a tank
  * Launch your rocket and drain the tank COMPLETELY. (Smart Parts has a fuel valve to help with that!)
  * Bring supplies and transfer these to the door.
  * Klick the door and convert empty tanks to empty space to living space
  * Bring kerbals to the door
* Right now all happens in the door. Depending on the feedback, I might continue this and extend it with connected living space support, etc
